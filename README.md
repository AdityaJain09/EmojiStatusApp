# EmojiStatusApp
Note: This App doesn't follow any architectural pattern because purpose of this app
is to learn firebase. I have several other apps that is built on clean architecture.

This app is an open source Emoji Status App where one can see update their emoji status and can see other person

firebase cloud firestore, firebase function. Other functionalities used in this app is
